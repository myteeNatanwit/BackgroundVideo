Playing Video in a supported browser is very easy. \r\nInfact, all functions, events are provided. Trying to work with QT on mobile. Next version then.\r\n\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n#Code\r\n\r\n<video id=\"video1\" autoplay loop muted>\r\n <source src=\"surf.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n</video>\r\n\r\nJust that much. on page load, it does autoplay, repeat forever with loop, and no sound with muted.\r\n\r\n#CSS\r\nThe fontbox is the issue bc it need to see thru, so set it with rbga(0,0,0,0.6). \r\nbody set overflow:hidden prevent browser showing scrollbars.\r\n\r\n##this version\r\nadded FullAndControl.html, with very simple Javascript to display video in full screen with control box. \r\nGave up on Css3 to do samething without JS. bugger!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
