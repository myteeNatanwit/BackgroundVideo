Actually, it seems like nice idea, took me like 10 mimutes to do it, but another 10 minutes to try to scale it to fit with background on resize ..er... fail -without JS-. next version will try to workout CSS3 to fill up the background then.\r\n\r\n================================================\r\n\r\n#Code\r\n\r\n<video autoplay loop muted>\r\n <source src=\"Waterfall.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\n</video>\r\n\r\nJust that much. on page load, it does autoplay, repeat forever with loop, and no sound with muted.\r\n\r\n#CSS\r\nThe fontbox is the issue bc it need to see thru, so set it with rbga(0,0,0,0.6). \r\nThe width and height of the video r set to 100%, just that the browser auto play it in its own propotion. Bugger! \r\n\r\n##next version\r\nNo glue, I did this on inspiration as someone seems showing interest on video background. Propably will come back for full screen playing one. Still not sure can do without JS. \r\nMy experiment using JS code is working fine, the video scaled to fill the full screen on resize. Looks cool. Lets c if I can optimize the code down.
